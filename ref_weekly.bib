Non-reciprocity occurs, for instance, in active matter1–6, non-equilibrium systems7–9, networks of neurons10,11, social groups with conformist and contrarian members12, directional interface growth phenomena13–15 and metamaterials16–20. Although wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been closely studied1,16–20, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behaviour of many-body systems. Here we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases in which spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are dynamically restored. We illustrate this mechanism with simple robotic demonstrations. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points21. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory22,23 and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics24,25. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point-enforced pattern formation and hysteresis. Our work lays the foundation for a general theory of critical phenomena in systems whose dynamics is not governed by an optimization principle.}, number={78547854}, journal={Nature}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Fruchart, Michel and Hanai, Ryo and Littlewood, Peter B. and Vitelli, Vincenzo}, year={2021}, month={Apr}, pages={363–369}, language={en} }

In the synchronized state, the individual cells or lasers coordinate the timing of their oscillations, but they do not move through space. A complementary form of self-organization occurs among swarming insects, flocking birds, or schooling fish; now the individuals move through space, but without conspicuously altering their internal states. Here we explore systems in which both synchronization and swarming occur together. Specifically, we consider oscillators whose phase dynamics and spatial dynamics are coupled. We call them swarmalators, to highlight their dual character. A case study of a generalized Kuramoto model predicts five collective states as possible long-term modes of organization. These states may be observable in groups of sperm, Japanese tree frogs, colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles, and other biological and physical systems in which self-assembly and synchronization interact.}, number={11}, journal={Nature Communications}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={O’Keeffe, Kevin P. and Hong, Hyunsuk and Strogatz, Steven H.}, year={2017}, month={Nov}, pages={1504}, language={en} }

Although different coupling topologies have already been considered, here we introduce time-varying competitive phase interaction among swarmalators where the underlying connectivity for attractive and repulsive coupling varies depending on the vision (sensing) radius. Apart from investigating some fundamental properties like conservation of center of position and collision avoidance, we also scrutinize the cases of extreme limits of vision radius. The concurrence of attractive-repulsive competitive phase coupling allows the exploration of diverse asymptotic states, like static $pi$, and mixed phase wave states, and we explore the feasible routes of those states through a detailed numerical analysis. In sole presence of attractive local coupling, we reveal the occurrence of static cluster synchronization where the number of clusters depends crucially on the initial distribution of positions and phases of each swarmalator. In addition, we analytically calculate the sufficient condition for the emergence of the static synchronization state. We further report the appearance of the static ring phase wave state and evaluate its radius theoretically. Finally, we validate our findings using Stuart-Landau oscillators to describe the phase dynamics of swarmalators subject to attractive local coupling.}, note={arXiv:2201.01598 [math-ph, physics:nlin, physics:physics]}, number={4}, journal={New Journal of Physics}, author={Sar, Gourab K. and Chowdhury, Sayantan Nag and Perc, Matjaz and Ghosh, Dibakar}, year={2022}, month={Apr}, pages={043004}, language={en} }
